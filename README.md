### The official LinuxMint logo subtly redesigned with a few pixels of difference

The choice of official color is left aside for now. These logos are currently in black and white and could be colored, or left as is. There are transparent parts. Use your image viewer to differentiate transparent parts from white.

These are SVG files. Use Inkscape to change the colors or do any other editing. I find it much safer to export these images to PNG format to ensure they are always displayed the same and there is no bad interpretations. Again, i recommend using Inkscape for these PNG exports. I am currently using Inkscape 1.0, installed from PPA. If you want to edit those files in Inkscape, you may need to ungroup or unlock some elements.

### I'm a perfectionist but late, sometimes
This is almost the current official logo. I created this small repository for two reasons: i couldn’t find the official logo, and i wanted to redraw the svg files with a bit more space around the "lm" inside the circle. Also, i generally prefer round numbers and thus everything here is made of round numbers and absolute pixel values. And i prefer having the exact same line width for both the "lm" and the circle around it. I should have mentioned that when Clem asked me for some feedback, but for some reason i did not care at the time and now Clem is probably very busy with other things such as this new LM 20.

### History
What follows is my version of the story, of course. And i am trying to make it a short story.

A competition was held to define the Linux Mint logo. The logo proposed by Carlos Porto won the vote. That was in year 2007. Ten years later, I installed Linux Mint on my little Netbook. I didn't like the logo that appeared on my screen. There was too many details and I didn't find much sense in it.

I set out to redraw this logo from scratch, on a blank page, and forgetting all those annoying details. I've searched the web and saw others have tried it before me. So I have the idea to share my creation. I'm afraid I won't be accepted so I set out to redo a logo similar to the official logo, but in a simple and flat version. I present this on the LM forums: [VOTE! Mint-Y-LOGO... A New Version Of The Linux Mint Logo!](Https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=280401)

In the comments received, in those that are positive, Reaccion Raul suggested a simpler background, if any, or just the "lm". And then Joan_2018 suggested doing that in black and white, without colors. And then, later, Clem presented us with a simplified logo with different backgrounds, mostly circular background shapes. So this logo is the result of collective work, in my humble opinion.

### Color
The official color is yet to be determined, as far as I know. Well, not exactly. Clem wants to keep a 90° hue (HSL color representation). That's a yellow-green. Saturation and brightness are still to be determined. Take note that in parallel with that, the colors of the Mint-Y theme are also to be redefined, as of late summer 2020. And that includes the Mint green.

I have worked on the issue of Mint-Y colors for a long time. There must be some good contrast with the white text, in the Nemo file manager for example. The official Mint hue is a green-yellow. This is a very bright color. It is therefore necessary to greatly reduce the saturation and lightness (HSL color representation). But then, I don't find it pretty. So I chose a whole other, unofficial hue. I'm still hesitating but I think about 150° or 160°. A turquoise green. Something that reminds me of mint soda. Let's say... this color: #00A870.
