### The official LinuxMint logo subtly redesigned with a few pixels of difference
![Preview of logo variations](https://github.com/SebastJava/linuxmint-logo/blob/master/Logos-prv.svg)

The choice of official color is left aside for now. Maybe this #009973 hex color? These logos are currently in black and white and could be colored, or left as is.

This is almost the current official logo. I created this small repository for two reasons: i couldnâ€™t find the official logo, and i wanted to redraw the svg files with a bit more space around the "lm" inside the circle. Also, i generally prefer round numbers and thus everything here is made of round numbers and absolute pixel values.
