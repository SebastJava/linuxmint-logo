### The official LinuxMint logo subtly redesigned with a few pixels of difference
![Preview of logo variations](https://github.com/SebastJava/linuxmint-logo/blob/master/linuxmint-logo-prv.png)

The choice of official color is left aside for now. These logos are currently in black and white and could be colored, or left as is. This is almost the current official logo. I created this small repo for two reasons: i couldnâ€™t find the official logo, and i wanted to redraw the svg files with a bit more space around the "lm" inside the circle. Also, i generally prefer round numbers and thus everything here is made of round numbers and absolute pixel values.
