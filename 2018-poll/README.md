### This Mint-Y-logo-02.svg is exactly the same design as the one proposed on the LinuxMint forum on October 2018.

But it got re-edited on 2022-04-16 for technical purposes. The design is still exactly the same, pixel-by-pixel, but the SVG coding behind the scene is now made much more simple, clear, and fast.
