# github.com/new/project: linuxmint-logo

There will be a GitHub-project for the LinuxMint logo on https://github.com/linuxmint sometimes soon. And there will be some guidelines, rules, and conventions there. I have a few questions for which i expect to find answers there.

* SVG or PNG file format?
* Are there any mandatory or preferred size and units? Example: 256x256 pixels (px)
* Does the image have to be a perfect square?
* There are no inside margins? Example: SVG file = 256x256 = logo size
* Can the logo be some rectangle in a square file, so there would be some horizontal or vertical margins? Example: SVG file = 256x256 px, but logo = 240x256 px...
* Can this logo be made of only a single stroke having some width? (SVG file)
* How-to create symbolic versions?
* Is there any official color?
