### Plymouth-CO
This is a very simple one. It was created to match this **Celestial Orbits Plymouth theme:** https://github.com/SebastJava/plymouth-theme-mint-logo-2/releases/tag/v4 <br>
It could be used as a wallpaper, but it was first intended to be used as a default background for the login screen. This makes a smooth transition from the booth splash screen to the login screen.
