### Wallpapers featuring the logo
I like it simple and zen. I am not trying to show you all that can be done with Inkscape. Prefer the **png** file formats. The **svg** files are only uploaded here as the sources files, for future edit purposes. Some wallpapers here are also fit for the login window. If you want to use one of these for the login window, you should open as root this /usr/share/backgrounds/ directory and place the **png** file there. This way it will be available system-wide.
