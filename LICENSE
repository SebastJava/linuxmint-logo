MODIFIED: This logo is brand new, created on a blank page. But the "LM" path is similar to that of the first logo dating from 2007 and created by Carlos Porto. I, Sébastien Bouchard, had redrawn the drawing of this "LM" in 2018, and I simply gave it to Clément Lefebvre (Clem) in 2019. And now, in 2021, I, Sébastien Bouchard, am creating new versions, again.

CONFLICTING INFORMATION ON THE LICENSE TO USE !
I decided in favour of what made more sense: CC-BY-3.0. 

I am obliged to license this logo. Partly because I would like to update the LinuxMint logo on Wikimedia and Wikipedia. Currently, the old version dating from 2007 is used on these sites. It was while trying to upload my new versions to Wikimedia that I was reminded of these obligations... But i am confused about which license to choose.

GPL LICENSE, ACCORDING TO merlwiz79

Back in October and November 2018, I raised this licensing issue. I had some discussions with xenopeek, forum administrator on https://forums.linuxmint.com. We had PM and talks on this https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=280557. There, we concluded that "The License that MUST be used is: GPLv3+" —sebastjava, according to xenopeek. Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20160424040927/http://www.linuxmint-art.org/content/show.php/Linux+Mint+Official+logos?content=90356 (username=merlwiz79) So, this logo is licensed under GPL according to... merlwiz79.

CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE, ACCORDING TO Clément Lefebvre (Clem)

Now, i wanted to update or try to replace this https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Linux_Mint_Official_Logo.svg. And there i found Clem writing "It is a logo uploaded under the Creative Commons license at: http://linuxmint-art.org/content/show.php/Official+logos+(white+background)?content=123381 The website clearly claims that it is being distributed under the Creative Commons license. [...]" —Clem

CONCLUSION

So, according to my differing sources, this logo has two different, conflicting licenses. But we probably all agree that the Creative Commons license is more appropriate. And it is this license that is required on Wikimedia Commons.
